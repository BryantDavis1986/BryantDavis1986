![My github stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=bryantdavis1986&show_icons=true&theme=onedark)

I have grown up in tech my entire life. Whether it was looking over my momâ€™s shoulder when she worked at Microsoft, learning HTML on notepad and dreamweaver in high school. All the way to learning computer logic and c++ in the Marine Corps. To this day, I still strive to learn technologies and languages in the world of software engineering.

Speaking of the Marine Corps, I am a Marine Corps veteran. I served 8 years as an Aviation Operations Specialist and during that time I spent 3.5 years in the middle east. As part of my job I was responsible for utilizing complex systems that tracked and ensured the reliability and operability of every component on multiple Marine Corps fixed wing aircraft.

As a non-commissioned officer and the operations chief I was trained and assigned to proficiently lead a team of 11 Marines to help accomplish this mission. I analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of my teammates and delegated tasks and responsibilities accordingly to increase efficiency when accomplishing a task.

As for my future career, being a good software engineer is not the only thing I strive to be but uplifting and motivating teammates around me is one of my highest priorities. 

I am a master at operating and delivering in high stress, fast paced environments, and am at my best when working in teams and collaborating ideas with others. All my experiences have led me to today, to what I hope to be is an amazing career in tech. whether that opportunity is near or far. Iâ€™m excited to take on the challenges head on that it will bring.

I am looking for a position as a Full Stack Software Engineer, Backend Software Engineer, FrontEnd Software Engineer to hone my craft that will continue to let me grow and challenge me.
